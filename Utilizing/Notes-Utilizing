# Chapter - The Build Process
#

Understanding Layers:-
  Images consist of multiple layers.

  Docker stores changes to an image, (as seen in a Dockerfile), as layers,
  i.e. the layers represent filesystem changes to the image over time.

  Not every instruction adds a layer, some only add metadata.
  e.g. the CMD instruction.

Creating Layers:-
  Layers are represented as hashed values which you can view by
  running 'docker image inspect <image identifier/tag>'

  Config can be seen in this output.

  Only Copy, Add and Run will create layers.

  FROM takes layers, and metadata from another image.

  Other commands add metadata to an image.

The Build Process:-
  The build process utilizes these layers to significantly speed
  up the build process. By storing hashed values of a layers contents,
  if that layer is already stored locally, the build process reuse it
  rather than needing to reconstruct the layer.

  Docker uses intermediate images to run the build process.

  running 'docker image build' with the '--no-cache' parameter
  will ensure that the image builds a fresh image, without using any
  cached layers.

How the Cache Works:-
  Its possible to see a highlevel view of the cache by running
  'docker image history <image name/tag>'.

  The cache evaluates the instruction, and compares that to whats in
  the Dockerfile. If it or the sequence before it has changed, then
  the cache won't be valid.

Invalidating the cache:-
  You can invalidate a cache by changing an instruction.
  You can also change the order of instructions or add a new
  instruction.

Copy and ADD:-
  Add - when fetching a resource, e.g. a file online, docker may
  check the HEAD of the resource to see when it was last modified.

  A file needs to be changed in order to invalidate the cache of 
  a layer that is obtained from the copy command.

  Changing the order of instructions will still force cache invalidation.

Dangling Images:-
  Are images that were used but might no longer be needed.
  'docker images prune' will remove unrequired images.

  'docker images prune -a' will remove all images that aren't referenced
  in another image.

Lightweight Images:-
  You should remove unnecessary files form an image etc.
  e.g. temp files.

  If you do so using independent commands, it will create
  multiple dependent layers, and won't reduce the size,
  so it becomes important to use command chaining in the 
  Dockerfile so that the resulting layer only contains
  the necessary files.

  You can create multiple lines, but have one instruction by
  using a backslash

The writable layer:-
  When running a container, the container makes use of the 
  layers created for it, and adds another layer for working memory
  called 'the writable layer'.

  'docker container ls -s' demonstrates this.

  You should avoid over-utilizing the writable layer in favour of
  volumes.

Hello World:-
  In a Dockerfile the 'WORKDIR' command allows you to specify 
  the current working directory of various items

Dockerfiles and quick starting:-
  Anything that can be done ahead of time should be.
  for example, when building an image, you should compile source
  code etc so that the container can start as quickly as possible
  when it is started.

Picking And Image:-
  Easiest to search for a programming language.
  Popular languages will likely have official images.
  
  You should pick a specific image and avoid the latest tag.

  slim and alpine versions are very lightweight versions.

Iterating with docker-compose:-
  Needing to frequently rebuild images and run them as you modify
  source code could become tedious. A more suitable task would 
  be to user a 'bind mount' to link src code with a folder in the
  directory. This way, you don't need to always rebuild images, as
  source code changes.

  You can use the 'command' argument to run the equivalent 'CMD'
  argument in a docker-compose file.

Running commands:-
  docker-compose run can allow you to execute commands in the context
  of your container.

  You should user the rm flag with docker-compose run otherwise, you end
  up with lot's of containers sticking around.
